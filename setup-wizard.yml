    title: Checkpoint for fast sync
    description: >-
      To get Nimbus up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Nimbus from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features. Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync. Check [Nimbus docs](https://nimbus.guide/trusted-node-sync.html)
      Use the DAppNode official endpoint at `https://checkpoint-sync.dappnode.io/` or get your checkpoint sync from [Infura](https://infura.io/) (i.e https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@eth2-beacon-chain.infura.io)

      Fee Recipient is a feature that lets you specify a priority fee recipient address on your validator client instance and beacon node. After The Merge, execution clients will begin depositing priority fees into this address whenever your validator client proposes a new block.
